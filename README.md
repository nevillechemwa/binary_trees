# Binary trees

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children. Each node of a binary tree consists of three items:

Data item
Address of left child
Address of right child
A binary tree is a special case of an ordered K-ary tree, where K is 2. In mathematics, what is termed binary tree can vary significantly from author to author. Some use the definition commonly used in computer science, but others define it as every non-leaf having exactly two children and don't necessarily order (as left/right) the children either.

There are many different types of binary trees, including:

Complete binary tree
Perfect binary tree
Balanced binary tree
Degenerate binary tree
Complete binary trees are binary trees in which all levels are filled entirely with nodes, except the lowest level of the tree. Perfect binary trees are binary trees in which all the internal nodes have strictly two children, and every external or leaf node is at the same level or same depth within a tree. Balanced binary trees are binary trees in which the tree height is O(logN), where 'N' is the number of nodes. Degenerate binary trees are binary trees in which all the nodes have only one child.

Binary trees are used in a variety of applications, including:

Data compression
Hashing
Routing data for network traffic
Preparing binary heaps
Binary search trees
Binary trees are a powerful data structure that can be used to solve a variety of problems. They are easy to understand and implement, and they are efficient in terms of both time and space.
